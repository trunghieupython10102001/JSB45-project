            <p class="section1-text">
            In 1980, a Vietnamese family of five decided to immigrate to the beautiful bay of San Francisco and opened a small diner named "Bowl of Phở" that served traditional phở with the price of $5 dollars each bowl. They they lived in a small area that was predominantly Asian, and thrived in the area. That wasn't until 2004 that the place became busier and busier each day, with more demand for authentic phở. The owner decided to take a big risk and transitioned the diner into a restaurant that mainly sell traditional Vietnamese food of all kinds.</br>
            </br>
            The move was proven to be sucessful as the income for the restaurant continue to increase. The restaurant became one of the best-selling restaurant in San Francisco Bay for Vietnamese food and continued to reach for higher places. In 2011, "Bowl of Phở" became the best-selling Vietnamese restaurant in the State of California.
